# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 18, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Discord Bot using discord.py, figured out how to show the instagram feed using both the bot and cv2.

**Thoughts:** The first half of the day was very unproductive and it's a bit difficult to decide what to work on. I'll try to find a more solid route by tomorrow.

**Today's Progress**: Worked with Discord bot along with a [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYeOw6sTSy6ZGyygcbta7GcpI8a5-Cooc).

**Thoughts**: It was pretty fun today, starting to learn how to write bots in a different way.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
