# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 18, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Discord Bot using discord.py, figured out how to show the instagram feed using both the bot and cv2.

**Thoughts:** The first half of the day was very unproductive and it's a bit difficult to decide what to work on. I'll try to find a more solid route by tomorrow.
