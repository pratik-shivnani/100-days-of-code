# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 18, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Discord Bot using discord.py, figured out how to show the instagram feed using both the bot and cv2.

**Thoughts:** The first half of the day was very unproductive and it's a bit difficult to decide what to work on. I'll try to find a more solid route by tomorrow.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
